pytuner
=======

A command line tool for listening to tune-in radio streams

I designed pytuner as a component for programatically searching live radio stations on tune-in and retrieving stream URLs, to be used in e.g. in embedded internet radio players. I was inspired by radio.py by Guy Rutenberg (http://www.guyrutenberg.com/radiopy/) which has similar purpose but the search functionality is less powerful, also the project has been unmaintained since 2009.
